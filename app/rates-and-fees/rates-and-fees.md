#Rates & Fees
AnyDayCash.com’s service is always free. AnyDayCash.com is not a lender or lending partner and does not provide lending services directly to consumers. Based on the information you submit, AnyDayCash.com searches its database housing its network of lenders and lending partners to connect you with a lender or lending partner and that may offer you a loan.

The Truth in Lending Act requires full disclosure of all loan fees and interest rates that borrowers may incur. All fees and rate information should be disclosed to you by your lender or lending partner at the time of approval. Upon the conclusion of lender or lending partner approval, most lenders and lending partners will direct you to an e-signature page. This page is provided to you by the lender or lending partner to which you were connected.
<br />
##Full Disclosure of Terms

The lender or lending partner provides documents that contain all fees and rate information pertaining to the loan being offered to you by the lender or lending partner. Please review the fee and rate information provided to you by your lender or lending partner at this time thoroughly and completely before agreeing to the terms of the loan. You are under no obligation to accept these terms. If you decide the loan terms detailed in the lender or lending partner contract are acceptable and wish to proceed with the loan process, e-sign the page and await transfer of your funds.

The loan fees and interest rates are determined solely by your lender or lending partner, with specific amounts determined based upon the information you submitted to the lender or lending partner. AnyDayCash.com has no control or knowledge of the loan details between you and your lender or lending partner. You are under no obligation to continue with the request process if you find a particular lender’s or lending partner’s loan terms unsuitable.

##Late Payment Policy

Lenders and lending partners have varying policies regarding late payments. Review the late payment policy detailed in the loan documents provided to you by your lender or lending partner before appending your e-signature, and thereby agreeing to the loan terms. All lenders and lending partners, however, must abide by applicable laws, rules, and regulations regarding late payment fees.
<br />
##Non-payment Policy

Additional fees or charges may apply to you in the event that you are unable to repay your loan. AnyDayCash.com uses commercially reasonable efforts to work only with reputable lenders and lending partners dedicated to pursuing collections of past due accounts with conduct that is fair and reasonable.
<br />
##Loan Renewal Policy

Loan renewal policies are largely governed by state regulatory legislation. In states where rollovers, or repayment term extensions, are allowed, interest rates, along with any late fees that may be assessed, can add a substantial dollar amount to the end price of your loan.
